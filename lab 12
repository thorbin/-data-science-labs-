###The Gapminder Data Set

The "gapminder" library in R contains worldwide country data, with variables that include country, continent, year, life expectancy, total population and per-capita GDP.

The questions we're interested in from this data set are:

1) Is there a difference in life expectancy between Nicaragua and Costa Rica?
2) Is there a correlation between life expectancy and total population?

These are important questions for understanding the relationship between a county's population and its relative health and safety. If life expectancy is a good measure of the well-being of a given country, then we should be interested in the variables that might be correlated with a higher or lower life expectancy.

The first of these questions will be answered with a mean permutation test. The second will be answered with a correlation permutation test.

```{r}

  Nica_cost_lifexp <-gapminder%>%filter(country %in% c("Nicaragua", "Costa Rica"))

## Data-based conclusions:


## Individual Contributions:

Jorge formulated the questions of interest and provided the mean permutation test. Ryan wrote the initial summary and conclusion and helped construct the correlation permutation test. Thorbin calculated the summary statistics and p-values, and he helped resolve knitting issues. Mandy created the visualizations and generated most of the conclusions based on the data. Erik helped in generalizing the function code to allow for different data sets.
