overall goal: how does economic progress affect different aspects of society. example: literacy rates, military, CO2 outputs, forestation

teams Analasys: we'll use jorge's findings as our team evaluation 


Jorge and teams Analasys:

step 1 :
Null hypothesis H0:ρ=0, There is no corralation between Kuwaits gdp and Literacy rates

Alternative hypothesis HA:ρ≠0 or HA:ρ<0 or HA:ρ>0, There is corralation between Kuwaits gdp and Literacy rates

importance: GDP is usually a reliable measure of a state's economic prosperity. By using literacy rates data, perhaps we may find a positive correlation with GDP.  I suspect that as people are more literate then that should reflect in the country's GDP because literacy is essential for business communication

```{r}

```

The corralation between Kuwaits GPD and Literacy rate are statictically significant.
correlation is positively strong. 


However, I believe that to have a more rigorous statistical conclusion we needed more observation in Literacy rates

#Ryan's section


The question I'm interested in asking is whether or not there is a correlation between a country's per capita economic growth and how much of its labor force it devotes to armed personnel. This is an important question because we could like to know the economic cost of the size of a military, for instance, and the effect it has on the overall economy.

First we import the data and perform some exploratory data analysis:

```{r}

data1<- read_csv("C:/Users/chele/Documents/stats_data_sci/lab13/gdp_per_capita_yearly_growth.csv")


data2<- read_csv("C:/Users/chele/Documents/stats_data_sci/lab13/armed_forces_personnel_percent_of_labor_force.csv")

#gdp_per_capita_yearly_growth <- read_csv("/Users/joro7386/Downloads/gdp_per_capita_yearly_growth.csv")

#armed_forces_personnel_percent_of_labor_force <- read_csv("/Users/joro7386/Downloads/armed_forces_personnel_percent_of_labor_force.csv")

library(reshape2)
#data1 <- gdp_per_capita_yearly_growth 
#data2 <- armed_forces_personnel_percent_of_labor_force 

data1m = data1 %>% 
  melt(id.vars = 'country')

data2m = data2 %>% 
  melt(id.vars = 'country')


gdp2 = data1m %>% 
  rename(year = variable, GDP = value)

armed_forces = data2m %>% 
  rename(year = variable, perc_of_labor_force = value)

gdp2 = gdp2 %>% 
  filter(year %in% armed_forces$year,
         country %in% armed_forces$country)
armed_forces = armed_forces %>% 
  filter(year %in% gdp2$year,
         country %in% gdp2$country)

head(map_dbl(armed_forces$perc_of_labor_force, mean))
head(map_dbl(gdp2$GDP, mean))

tail(map_dbl(armed_forces$perc_of_labor_force, mean))
tail(map_dbl(gdp2$GDP, mean))
```

We don't see any obvious relationship between large militaries and either high or low economic growth. It might be better to analyze a particular country--say, the United States. We can use a map function to generate the US's mean per capita GDP and proportion of armed forces personnel as a percentage of the labor force:

```{r}
US_gdp = gdp2 %>% filter(country == "United States")
US_armed_forces = armed_forces %>% filter(country == "United States")

mean(US_gdp$GDP)
mean(US_armed_forces$perc_of_labor_force)

```

We now set up our permutation correlation function and then calculate a correlation:

```{r}

perm_cor <- function(perms = 1000, x, y)
{
  
  perm_mean_diffC <- numeric(perms)
  # Loop throught number of permutations
  for (i in c(1:perms))
  {
    # Step 2:
    # Randomly mix up the values in the vector "y"
    rand_order_y <-sample(y)
    # Step 3:
    # Compute the correlation between x and the randomly mixed
    # up y-vector. Store this value in the vector from step 1.
    
    vc<-cor(x, rand_order_y) 
    
    perm_mean_diffC[i]= vc
    
  }
  
  # Step 4:
  # Return new updated vector, created in step 1
  return(perm_mean_diffC)
}



US_gdp$year <- as.numeric(gsub("X","",as.character(US_gdp$year)))

US_armed_forces$year <- as.numeric(gsub("X","",as.character(US_armed_forces$year)))

US_gdp$GDP <- as.numeric(gsub("X","",as.character(US_gdp$GDP)))

US_armed_forces$perc_of_labor_force <- as.numeric(gsub("X","",as.character(US_armed_forces$perc_of_labor_force)))

head(US_armed_forces)

xc<-US_gdp$GDP
yc<-US_armed_forces$perc_of_labor_force




xyc<-perm_cor(perms = 1000, xc, yc)

cor.test(xc,yc)

```

We see that we have a correlation of -0.1419413, which means a weak negative correlation between military spending and economic growth.

We have a p-value of .48, which means that our result is not statistically significant. We can visualize this:

```{r warning=FALSE}

ggplot(, aes(x=xyc)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha=.9, fill="darkslategrey")+
  labs(title="Permutated Correlation Distribution", 
       subtitle="Correlation Distribution differences between per capita GDP and armed forces as % of labor market",
       x="Difference in Correlation Distribution"
  )+ geom_segment(aes(x = -0.57290771,y =0, xend = -0.9, yend = 0))+ 
  geom_segment(aes(x = -0.57290771,y =0, xend = -0.57290771, yend = 27))+
  geom_segment(aes(x =  0.64522201,y =0, xend = 0.9, yend = 0))+
  geom_segment(aes(x =  0.64522201,y =0, xend =  0.64522201, yend = 27))+
  geom_vline(xintercept = cor(xc,yc), color="red")

```


The conclusion is that, although we see a weak negative correlation between military spending and economic growth, the results of analyzing only one country with this method do not give us anything statistically significant.

What is the subquestion you are addressing? - Is there a correlation between CO2 emissions and income?

tail(map_dbl(CO2emissions$emissions, mean))
## We see an obvious correlation between an increase income and CO2 emissions. But are they dependent on one another?

##We now set up our permutation correlation function and then calculate a correlation:

Let's just look at the United States:

income <- income %>% filter(country == 'United States')
CO2emissions <- CO2emissions %>% filter(country == 'United States')

mean(income$income)
mean(CO2emissions$emissions)

income$year <- as.numeric(gsub("X","",as.character(income$year)))

CO2emissions$year <- as.numeric(gsub("X","",as.character(CO2emissions$year)))

income$income <- as.numeric(gsub("X","",as.character(income$income)))

CO2emissions$emissions <- as.numeric(gsub("X","",as.character(CO2emissions$emissions)))

xc<- income$year
yc<- CO2emissions$year
xyc <-perm_cor(perms = 1000, xc, yc)

cor.test(xc,yc)
# We see a direct positive correlation of 1 between income and CO2 emissions.
