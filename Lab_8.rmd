```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
Tang <- read_excel("East Africa lake data.xlsx")

```

What we need:

* a general overall question you want to answer using data (you may end up changing your question next week)

* an explanation of why that question is important or interesting and a deeper explanation of why those reasons are important or     interesting

* a reference to at least one dataset you plan on using to answer this overall question
who the “pretend” domain expert is (and why they think the overall question is important and interesting)

* each person's individual African Lake visualization.
