##analasys Jorge: Trends surrounding the production of milk throughout the United States of America has serious implication concerning the local availability of milk.
#                 It seems that as the year passes most states have a constant mean in milk production. However, California, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Idaho, and NewYork display a #                 strong positive correlation in milk production as time goes by. 
#                 The inherent problem of producing a disproportionally large amount of milk in a few states is that if transportation cost would increase then those states    #                 that don't have local access a large amount of milk production will not be able to meet the demands of milk consumption.
#                 Ultimately this will have a negative impact in that sector of the economy.
