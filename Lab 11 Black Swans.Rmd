```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(babynames)
library(dplyr)
```


Thorbins stuff:
```{r}
#strategy: find the say 20 most popular names in any given year then plot their prop as a time series that way we dont have to deal with any silly regular expression BS. 
male<-filter(babynames,sex=="M",year>=2007) %>% group_by(name) %>%arrange(desc(prop))
#most popular name for 2007-2008 is Jacob
female<-filter(babynames,sex=="F",year>=2007) %>% group_by(name) %>% arrange(desc(prop))
```
